# Capstone-Project

In the Total War: Warhammer III community, I feel as though there is a void when it comes to detailed guides on how to play each faction in the Immortal Empires Campaign.
To attempt to fill this void, I have created a conceptual website filled with guides, as well as tips and tricks for all Warhammer III playable factions.
